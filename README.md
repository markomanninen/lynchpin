# Lynchpin Geometry Visualization

## Overview

This project provides a 3D interactive model of the Lynchpin geometry, which is based on the geometric properties of a tetrahedron and pentagon. The concept, initially discussed by Terrence Howard, involves exploring the relationship between these geometric shapes and their potential engineering applications.

## Concept and Background

The Lynchpin concept, as described by Terrence Howard, involves fundamental geometric principles. This project demonstrates the geometry using a tetrahedron and pentagons, focusing on the small discrepancies between their internal angles. The Lynchpin model showcases how six pentagons can be aligned with a tetrahedron's centroid, considering the angle discrepancies similar to the Pythagorean comma in musical tuning.

## Features

- **3D Interactive Model**: View and interact with the Lynchpin geometry.
- **Geometric Calculations**: Demonstrates the internal angles and centroids of tetrahedrons and pentagons.
- **Discrepancy Visualization**: Highlights the small angle differences between the tetrahedron and pentagon structures.

## Detailed Explanation

### Tetrahedron Basics

A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional polyhedron with four triangular faces, six straight edges, and four vertices. Each face is an equilateral triangle with internal angles of \(60^\circ\).

### Centroid of the Tetrahedron

The centroid is the point where the medians intersect and is equidistant from all vertices. This is also the center of the circumscribed sphere around the tetrahedron.

### Internal Angle from the Centroid to the Vertices

The internal angle from the centroid to any vertex in a regular tetrahedron is approximately \(109.47^\circ\).

### Pentagon Geometry

A regular pentagon has five equal sides and internal angles of \(108^\circ\). The radius of the circumscribed circle around a pentagon with side length 1 is approximately 0.85 units.

### Tetrahedron and Pentagon Angle Discrepancy

The small discrepancy between the tetrahedron's internal angle and the pentagon's internal angle is approximately \(1.47^\circ\). This discrepancy ratio is similar to the Pythagorean comma in musical tuning.

### Pythagorean Comma

The Pythagorean comma is the small interval by which twelve perfect fifths exceed seven octaves, illustrating imperfections in tuning systems.

### Comparing the Ratios

The angle discrepancy in the Lynchpin geometry and the Pythagorean comma both show small but perceptible differences that are manageable in engineering applications.

## Conclusion

The Lynchpin geometry and its associated discrepancies demonstrate the fascinating interplay between geometric shapes and their potential applications. This project provides an interactive way to explore these concepts and visualize the relationships between different geometric structures.
